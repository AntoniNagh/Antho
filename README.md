Week 1, my first finished scripts

The math.py file is supposed to be a super simple calculator, the different calculation methods were written in swedish so sorry bout that lol
the movies.py file is supposed to ask you about your top 3 movies and rank them for you
the rectangle.py file will take the dimensions of a provided rectangle and give the area of the rectangle
the dictionary.py file will ask about your favorite streamer, age, cars and save that, it gives the options to change any of the saved info about the streamers. 

This is my first 5 days of programming so im sorry if some of these stuff are bad or whatevr.
